	* t: Added versions tests, Devel::Cover reports are looking nicer.
	* SIGNATURE: I'm using Module::Signature now.
	* lib/File/Find/Match.pm: We're passing the filename as the first argument to
	predicates and actions now, rather than setting $_. This is cleaner, and apparently
	faster. But speed isn't as important as the cleanness.

	* lib/File/Find/Match.pm: _API_CHANGE_ We're going back to as it was in days of old, 
	with file => instead of file { ... }. It really is a better design. In additon:
	default is magical -- it is always executed last. A string predicate not matching
	/^file|dir|default$/ will be evaluated as perl code. So you can write predicates like
	this: -r = sub { print "Readable by effective UID!\n" }.
	* lib/File/Find/Match/Sugar.pm: This file is deprecated. use'ing it will result in a
	fatal error, explaining the incompatibilty between 0.06 .. 0.07 and 0.08.
	I appologize for the API change, but this is still not 1.0. :)
	* lib/File/Find/Match/Util.pm: Some utility functions for writing clean rulesets.
	Includes only filename().

	* lib/File/Find/Match.pm: Fixed up documentation, changed the meaning of
	string predicates. Removed PASS constant and made it the default behavior.
	Released version to CPAN. Decided to remove syntax-sugar functions and put
	them in File::Find::Match::Sugar.
	* lib/File/Find/Match/Sugar.pm: Created this file to hold file(), dir(),
	and default(), plus associated documentation.
