File::Find::Match version 0.08
===================

This module provides a replacement for File::Find,
with some difference. Major difference include:
  * breadth-first algorithm.
  * Only traverses directories we're interested in.

INSTALLATION

Before you install, you might want to try running
cpansign -v, to verify that this module is not trojaned.
See man Module::Signature for details. 

If Module::Signature is not installed, then you can't do this.
That's okay, though. It is not required.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

If you do not have Module::Build installed, run Makefile.PL
to install it, or grab it from CPAN.

DEPENDENCIES

This module does not require any other modules at runtime,
but requires Module::Build for installation and Test::More
to run the test suite.

Test::Pod is optionally used to test the POD documentation.
If it is not installed, the t/004_pod.t test will be skipped.
