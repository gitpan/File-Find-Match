This module provides a replacement for File::Find,
with some difference. Major difference include:
  * breadth-first algorithm.
  * Only traverses directories we're interested in.

INSTALLATION

If you do not have Module::Build installed, run Makefile.PL

DEPENDENCIES

but requires Module::Build for installation and Test::More
to run the test suite.
