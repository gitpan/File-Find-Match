File::Find::Match version 0.01
===================

This module provides a replacement for File::Find,
with some difference. Major difference include:
  * breadth-first algorithm.
  * Return value of callback \&wanted function is important,
    and is used to determine if we are to descend into a directory
	or not.

It also includes a function for greating \&wanted functions
that will execute different actions depending on the file name matching a regular expression.

Simple example:

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use File::Find::Tsite qw( :all );

find(match(
	qr/\.svn/  => sub { IGNORE },
	qr/_build/ => sub { IGNORE },
	qr/\.pm$/  => sub {
		print "Perl module: $_\n";
		return DONE; # default is still executed.
	},
	default    => sub {
		if (-d $_) {
			print "$_/\n";
		} else {
			print "$_\n";
		}
	},
), '.');
