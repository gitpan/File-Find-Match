=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is allows one to recursively process files and directories
based on the filename. It is meant to be more flexible than File::Find.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(%opts)

Creates a new C<File::Find::Match> object.
Currently %opts is ignored.

If you are going to sublcass C<File::Find::Match>, you may
override initialize() which new() calls right after object creation.

=head2 rules($predicate => $action, ...)

rules() accpets a list of $predicate => $action pairs.

See L</RULES> for a detailed description.

=head2 rule($predicate => $action)

This is just an alias to rules().

=head2 find(@dirs)

Start the breadth-first search of @dirs (defaults to '.' if empty)
using the specified rules.

The return value of this function is unimportant.

=head1 EXPORTS

Two constants are exported: C<IGNORE> and C<MATCH>.

See L</Actions> for usage.

=head1 RULES

A rule is a predicate => action pair.

A predicate is the code (or regexp, see below) used to determine if
we want to process a file.

An action is the code we use to process the file.
By process, I mean anything from sending it through a templating engine to printing
its name to C<STDOUT>.


=head2 Predicates

A predicate is one of: a Regexp reference from C<qr//>,
a subroutine reference, or a string.

Naturally for regexp predicates, matching occures when the pattern matches
the filename.

For coderef predicates, the coderef is called with one argument:
the filename to be matched.
If it returns a true value, the predicate is true. Else the predicate is false.

The 'default' string predicate is magical.
It must only be specified as a predicate once, and it is called after
all predicates, regardless of the order.

The 'dir' string predicate is the same as C<sub { -d $_[0] }>.

The 'file' string predicate is the same as C<sub { -f $_[0] }>.

Any other string will be evaluated as perl code.
In addition, $_ will be set to the first argument.
Thus a predicate of '-r' is the same as sub { -r $_[0] } (because -r defaults to using $_).

Any exceptions (e.g. calling C<die()>, or synax errors) within the eval'd perl code
will be raised to the caller.


=head2 Actions

An action is just a subroutine reference that is called when its associated
predicate matches a file. When an action is called, 
its first argument will be the filename.


If an action returns C<IGNORE> or C<MATCH>, all following rules will not be tried.
You should return C<IGNORE> when you do not want to recurse into a directory, and C<MATCH>
otherwise. On non-directories, both C<MATCH> and C<IGNORE> do the same thing: 
they prevent the next rule from being tried.

If an action returns niether C<IGNORE> nor C<MATCH>, the next rule will be tried.
